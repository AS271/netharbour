                             RELEASE NOTES
============================================================================== 
See COPYING for the license details

Version: 1.6 
Date:    Oct 11, 2012
Author:  Andree Toonk // Andree@Toonk.nl  Andree.Toonk@bc.net (might not be working much longer)

Important Notices:
*	BCNET and The University of British Columbia (UBC) have released the software as open source. 
	It is licensed under the GPLv2 license See COPYING file for details


New features:

*	Support for performance data in event checks. If performance data is supplied RRD files will be created and shown to the user in the websinterface.
	Performance data format is expected according to nagios specs:
	Expected format of $performance_data is multiple label value tuples
                separated by comma whitespace ", "  example:
                percent_packet_loss=0, rta=0.80
                
                This is the nagios plugin perfomance data format:
                'label'=value[UOM];[warn];[crit];[min];[max] 
                For now we don't implement [warn];[crit];[min];[max] , just the data
                UOM (unit of measurement) is one of:
                
                no unit specified - assume a number (int or float) of things (eg, users, processes, load averages)
                s - seconds (also us, ms)
                % - percentage
                B - bytes (also KB, MB, TB)
                c - a continuous counter (such as bytes transmitted on an interface)

                This will be implemented as all GAUGE RRD datatypes
                except for c - a continuous counter, this should be COUNTER/DERIVE 


*	Support for REST like submit method for event state changes. Sort of similar as passive checks in Nagios only RestFULL. 
	This allows for traps, instead of just relying on polling. Also ideal for if a certain check can not be done by polling.
	submit-event.php accepts both POST and GET. 

	For existing checks, it best if you know the check id. Specify check_id, action=submit_event and a check status (noaios status, 0 -4) and a message:
	http://nms.mgmt.bc.net/cmdb-svn/submit-event.php?check_id=3&message=test123&action=submit_event&status=1

	Alternatively, If you don't know the check_id then specify: hostname and checkname, key1 and optionally key2 as arguments. Example:
	http://nms.mgmt.bc.net/cmdb-svn/submit-event.php?hostname=cr1.victx1.bc.net&checkname=BGP%20Shaw%20VICTX1&key1=192.0.2.1&message=I am up&action=submit_event&status=0



Partially implemented:

* 	Split up the notification part for event state changes. This used to be hard coded in classes/Event.php.
	Right now classes/Event.php calls notify() which in turn can call different plugins. The only available plugin right now is ./notify_by_email.php which sends the email. 
	The idea is that in the future you can write your own notification scripts and set them per check.
	So it's easier to change the notification method and/or email layout.

* 	Service template for Virtual routers 

* 	Accounting support for regular RRD (interface) files. So no longer just for Juniper SCU-DCU data. 
 	The user interface needs to be updated to reflect these changes.


============================================================================== 
Version: 1.5 
Date:    June 1, 2011
Author:  Andree Toonk

Important Notices:
* 	When adding comments to config/cmdb.conf from now on use #; instead of just #
	this is to keep it compatible with future versions of the php.ini format
*	You'll need to add email addresses to the cmdb/cmdb.conf file for notification to work
	also see "Configurable emails for notifications" below.


New Features
*	IP Address management solutions IPAM
	This versions ships with an the "IP Manager" plugin. It's an IPAM solution with support 
	for IPv4, IPv6 as well as VLANs. It's has reporting capabilities. At this point in time
	it's the worlds most advance opensource IPv4 and IPv6 address manager. This IP manager was developed 
	by consultant Henry Leung, paid for by a Canarie IPv6 grant.

*	Nested aggregated graphs
	The aggregated graphs config file 'config/graph.conf' now supports nested aggregated graphs.
	These go in an array called $nested_aggregrated_graph_traffic. It allows to add a second level 
	of aggregation. Below an example:

	$nested_aggregrated_graph_traffic = array(
	  "Total UBC Campus" =>array(
		"Transit" => array($aggregrated_graph_traffic['Total Campus Transit']),
		"Oran" => array($aggregrated_graph_traffic['Total Campus Research (Canarie) Traffic']),
		"Local Peering" => array($aggregrated_graph_traffic['Total Campus Local Peering Traffic']),
	  ),
	);
	
	This will create a graph with 3 lines/areas Transit, Oran and Local Peering. 
	Each of these items are an array itself. In the example above it refenced them from the array
	$aggregrated_graph_traffic

*	Threshold check
	The SNMP Poller plugin now has support for Threshold checks and notifications.
	When using the threshold checker, a user will receive alerts if an interface is utilized
	for more the 90% of its capacity, or if there are more than 10 errors.
	This feature can be enabled by adding the following line to config/cmdb.conf
	threshold_check = 1
	To disbale set it to 0: threshold_check = 0
	This is a global setting and currently can not be enabled / disabled on a per devices basis
	The script './plugins/SNMP_Poller/check_threshold.pl' Allows you to set the default thresholds variables.
	for interface utilization and errors. Email are send to the email_to variable defined in config/cmdb.conf

*	Configurable emails for notifications.
	config/cmdb.conf now requires the following entries for notification to work correctlty:
	email_to = "network-notifications@bc.net"
	email_from = "BCNET CMDB Account <network-notifications@bc.net>"
	Currently this is used by the event notification class and the threshold plugin.
	Multiple accounts can be added using a comma as seperator.

* 	IP calculator Dashboard widget
	An IPv4 and IPv6 calculator implemented as a widget using the class files
	that come with the IP manager plugin.
	
	
Bug fixes 
*	Bug fix in RRD.php to solve issues when entriy in rrd file is NaN (not a number).
	This sometimes leads to incorrect calculations. Where possible calculations are now done using
	ADDNAN instead of "+" and PERCENTNAN instead of PERCENT
*	Scrolable modal window. 
	modal windows are now scrolable. Usefull for when there's a lot of data in a modal window
*	Search for interfaces now correctly shows layer3 services
